# Mentisano - Self care is how you take your power back

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Mentisano is a mental health care application focusing on people suffering from various mental health issues. Our app helps people cope with symptoms, share their stories, and completely calming. It will also provide useful data about physicians, therapists, and health care informatics experts near them. Most importantly it will help lonesome people rent a family member or friend for them. People can be busy overworking themselves or struggling to connect with people in the real world offline. So what’s it’s like to go on a date with someone or what’s it’s like to have a mother cooking for you at home and having some to go out with. It’s an ALL IN 1 app. As it's totally visible in today’s era, we are so much occupied in our personal work or endeavors that we don’t pay attention to interacting with someone in real life or spending some time with family. Our app may be a reminder to people that self-care and love to others are equally important as your professional life.
